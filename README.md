# unicorn_pHAT
Expanding on a binary clock project for the Raspberry Pi Unicorn pHAT

Inspired by Frederick Vandenbosch's project: https://www.instructables.com/Pi-Zero-Binary-Clock/


### Notes:
The `unicornhat` library requires you to run programs as a superuser

run `bc.py` with: `sudo -E python3 bc.py`
